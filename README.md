# Some Rust Fer Yeh!

This is my rust playground, were I put together little snippits I find, and
little works of my own into a record of my experience.

This isn't meant to hold a huge repository containing some app I've made.
It's just a place I can share some fun.

To compile snippits of the repository: `make [SNIPPIT-1] [SNIPPIT-2]...`
To list the snippits available to try: `make list`
To compile all snippits in the repository: `make all`

***Currently thinking about compiling these to webassembly and shoving them
onto my website just cause it's more content I get to display...***
